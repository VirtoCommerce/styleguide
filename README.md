# Virto Commerce Style Guides
The Virto Commerce style guide includes documentation on design, branding, and code implementation.

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” 

This project 
([VirtoCommerce/styleguide](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Virto Commerce code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Virto Commerce, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.
