# Virto Commerce Style Guides
The Virto Commerce style guide includes documentation on design, branding, and code implementation.

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” 

This project 
([VirtoCommerce/styleguide](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Virto Commerce code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Virto Commerce, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

## Style vocabulary

Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.

The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.

**Do** is one that should always be followed. Always might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do guideline.

**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Please strive to be consistent.

**Avoid** indicates something you should almost never do. Code examples to avoid have an unmistakable red header.

**Do not** Just don't do it.

**Why?** gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.
